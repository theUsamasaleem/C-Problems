Covid’19 vaccination has become a mandatory requirement for many things such as traveling, bank account opening, admissions in higher educational universities, and many more. Develop a C - program that facilitates the hospital in determining which person needs to be vaccinated based on age and underlying disease. The program should run for N persons and perform the followings: (N should be taken as a user input).
I. if age is greater than or equal to 18 and person belongs to the Urban area of a city then program should display the following message:
Eligible for the vaccine. Kindly proceed for the vaccination
II. if age is less than 18 and person to the Rural area of a city then program should display the following message:
Not Eligible for the vaccine. Kindly wait for the vaccination

Alice and Bob want to exchange the n- digits message on the internet, but they want to ensure the security. They went to a cyber security specialist Edwin for the solution. Edwin listened to the requirement of the clients and proposed a scheme for cryptography, which is mentioned in following points
1. The algorithm would reverse the message
2. After reverting the message, it would determine an alphabetic character against the digit. For example, for 0 it would be A, for 1 it would be B, for 2 it would be C, for Z it would be 25.
Write a C - program for the above cryptographic algorithm using loops in C for Edwin.
The samples are like:
Input String
Cypher Text
1546
GEFB
7777
HHHH
5555
FFFF
1234
EDCB
Also provide the solution for decryption the message. (System should ask user for encryption and decryption at the start of the program)
